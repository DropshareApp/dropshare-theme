# dropshare-theme

dropshare-theme is a new, responsive HTML5 landing page for dropshare based on Zurb Foundation 6.

## Demo
https://alinuxninja.github.io/dropshare-theme/

## Setup
To do a simple setup, simply copy the contents of [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ALinuxNinja/dropshare-theme/master/index.html) and paste it into Dropshare as a custom landing page. This automatically makes github host all the external elements (Background, CSS, Javascript/etc).

To host the external elements yourself, simply download all the external elements, upload them to your favourite file host, and update the URLs in the landing page to point to your own.

To modify the landing page, clone the git repository and you can begin using it as a foundation project. Remember to install all node and bower components before use.
